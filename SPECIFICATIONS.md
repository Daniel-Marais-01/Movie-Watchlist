<h1>Movie WatchlistðŸŽ¬</h1>

<h2>Entertainment & Media</h2>

<p>The Movie Watchlist App is designed for movie and TV enthusiasts, content creators, and streaming service users who want to organize, track, and discover films efficiently. With the growing number of streaming platforms and vast content libraries, itâ€™s easy for users to lose track of movies they plan to watch. This app solves that problem by offering a centralized platform where users can create personalized watchlists, receive recommendations, and engage with the film community.</p>

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<p>With the increasing number of streaming services and movies available, many users struggle to keep track of what they want to watch. Without a centralized system, they often rely on memory or scattered notes, leading to frustration and missed opportunities to watch their favorite films. Existing solutions are either difficult to use, lack personalization, or do not support tracking content across multiple platforms.

The Movie Watchlist App aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and user-friendly platform where users can organize, track, and discover movies easily. The app allows users to create personalized watchlists, receive recommendations based on their preferences, and stay updated on where movies are available. Features such as reminders, ratings, and social sharing help improve the overall experience, making movie tracking more convenient and enjoyable.</p>

<h1>Indivdual Scope: Feasibility Justification</h1>

<h2>Scope</h2>
The Movie Watchlist App will provide a platform where users can organize, track, and discover movies and TV shows across different streaming services. The app will include the following key features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Personalized Watchlists: Users can add, remove, and categorize movies they plan to watch.
Movie Information Retrieval: Fetch movie details such as ratings, trailers, and cast from external APIs (e.g., TMDb or IMDb).
Streaming Service Availability: Indicate where a movie can be streamed (Netflix, Disney+, etc.).
Reminders and Notifications: Notify users when a movie becomes available or a release date approaches.
AI-Based Recommendations: Suggest movies based on user preferences and watch history.
Social Features: Allow users to share watchlists and see what friends are watching.
The system will be developed using React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and Firebase (database and authentication).

<h2>Feasibility</h2>

Technical Feasibility: The required technologies (React, Node.js, Firebase) are well-documented and widely used. Existing APIs (e.g., TMDb) can provide movie data, reducing development time.
Operational Feasibility: Users will find the system easy to navigate, and features such as watchlists and notifications will improve their movie-watching experience.
Economic Feasibility: The app can start as a free platform, with potential monetization through premium features, ads, or affiliate marketing with streaming services.
Time Feasibility: A minimum viable product (MVP) with core features (watchlists, authentication, and movie tracking) can be built within a few months.

<h2>Justification</h2>

The Movie Watchlist App is necessary because users frequently lose track of movies they want to watch due to content overload across multiple streaming platforms. Existing solutions either lack cross-platform integration, have limited tracking features, or are not user-friendly.

By creating a simple, centralized solution, this app improves user experience, reduces frustration, and provides added convenience through personalized recommendations and reminders. The app aligns with current trends in media consumption and has potential for future growth, making it a valuable and scalable project.
